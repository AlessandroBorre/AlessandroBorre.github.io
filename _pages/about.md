Hey there! I’m Alessandro Borre, an environmental engineer who’s super passionate about understanding how natural events unfold and figuring out ways to better manage the risks they bring. Right now, I’m in the final stretch of my PhD at the University of Genoa, working closely with the CIMA Research Foundation. I spend my days diving into how extreme events, like floods and storms, connect with each other and how we can get better at handling what comes after.

My journey started with a master’s degree in Environmental and Land Engineering from Politecnico di Torino, and I’ve been lucky enough to collaborate with great institutions like IIASA in Vienna, where I got to explore systemic risk and resilience.

In my work, I’m all about practical, hands-on solutions that help us face big challenges like climate change and natural hazards. I’ve written a bunch of scientific essays on these topics, and if you’re into that kind of stuff, you’ll definitely find updates here.

But it’s not all about science and numbers! On this site, I’ll share things that really fire me up—whether it’s progress on my projects, some interesting reads, or just thoughts on the world of environmental engineering. Oh, and I’m planning to kick off a podcast soon, where I’ll sit down with other experts to chat about all things environment and risk.

When I’m not buried in data, you can probably find me out playing football or skiing in the mountains—two sports that have been part of my life for as long as I can remember.

Thanks for stopping by my site! I hope you’ll find something here that sparks your interest, and who knows, maybe even some fresh ideas. See you around!
